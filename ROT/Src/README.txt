The files herein are source files and a MSVC 2008 project; which you should let you compile and run the game.

Project fileName: qtGameStates.sln

I have tried to include only the relevant external src code and libraries. Please see that these are all under the LGPL license.

If in case the game does not run for you or have any feedback for me, please email me @ fly2priyank AT gmail.com. It would help me if you could provide a small description of what error message it burped at you.

Thank you and have fun!
