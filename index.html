				As a lead engineer with seven+ years of engineering experience across the stack, I enjoy both technical and creative aspects of product development. I've had the opportunity of working very close to the hardware with defining version 1 of the product, defining the SDK and even establishing processes. I've had to don different hats in these years, from having worked in the user and kernel driver space at nvidia, to being a game developer at EA sports. This exposed me to a lot of creative challenges and constantly forced me to step up my game. <br> <br >

				I find finishing a product/game to be a very rewarding experience, since it requires both attention to detail and involves working with creative and intelligent people. <br> <br >

				If you wish to contact me to discuss my work, feel free to reach out to me at: <a href="mailto:fly2priyank@gmail.com">fly2priyank at gmail.com</a>.

				<!-- I graduated in May 2010 with a M.S. in Computer Science from University of North Carolina, Charlotte, with a focus in graphics. My focus over these two years has been in writing efficient code and learning software architecture by applying concepts to solving real-time problems. Game development served as my testbed since these are complex systems and wiring them together with efficient code is the key. --> <br> <br >
				
				<!-- My experience at UNC Charlotte laid the foundation in graphics and gave me an opportunity to learn from varied subjects such as computational photography, game design and development, virtual reality and computational geometry. During this time, I also got interested in developing games as it gave me a platform to try out new ideas. Making games has challenged me to think beyond what I have learnt and realize those ideas into practical implementation. <br><br> -->
				
				<!-- I was working as a software engineer at <strong> Electronic Arts </strong> developing next generation games for the handheld Nintendo 3DS. With not much time to spare and busy deadlines, I had to quickly bring myself upto speed with their existing system and packages. This process of learning on the job has been very challenging and exciting at the same time. Collaborating with User interface designer and artists established the flow of ideas which turned out to be effective and helped me deliver milestones on time. More details can be found <a href="resume.html" target="_parent" class="gameTitle">here</a>. <br><br> -->
				
				<!-- <a href="projects.html#Kolor" target="_parent" class="gameTitle"> Kolor</a>, a game mechanic I came up, wherein the player claims other people by coloring them into your own color. I think this project has really helped me see how a game idea is transformed into a working game. The details and the progress I've made so far can be seen <a href="projects.html#Kolor" target="_parent" class="gameTitle"> here</a>. <br><br> -->
				
				<!-- As a part of my side-projects, I am developing a 3D First-Person Shooter game, <a href="projects.html#Kolor" target="_parent" class="gameTitle"> Kolor </a>. I have written this game from scratch in C++/OpenGL and Qt Framework. Amidst other things that I did, I am very proud of the library that I wrote to parse and process a Collada DAE model file. This project is quite sizeable and proves to be a good testbed for new concepts that I like to try. The details and the progress I've made so far can be seen <a href="projects.html#Kolor" target="_parent" class="gameTitle"> here</a>. <br><br>  -->
				
				<!-- My first independently developed game, <a class="gameTitle" href="projects.html#Juhuligan" target="_parent"> Juhuligan</a>, is a mario-contra clone. The objective was to re-create the original game with a little twist. I learnt a lot while working on this project. Check out the game and the details <a href="projects.html#Juhuligan" target="_parent" class="gameTitle"> here</a>. <br><br> -->

				<!-- <a href="projects.html#ROT" target="_parent" class="gameTitle"> Revenge of the Tanks (ROT)</a> was inspired by my childhood favorite game, Scorched earth (dates back to MSDOS days). Ever since I got into making games, I wanted to recreate something similar, and <a href="projects.html#ROT" target="_parent" class="gameTitle">ROT</a> was the result. The game executable and details can be found <a href="projects.html#ROT" target="_parent" class="gameTitle"> here</a>. <br><br> -->
								
				<!-- I am currently working as a Research Assistant with Dr. Zachary Wartell at UNC, Charlotte. We are trying to reconstruct the terrain surface from a point cloud. I am trying to implement this using the Marching Triangle algorithm. My work with Dr. Wartell has helped me enhance my knowledge in computational geometry, half-edge data structures, delaunay Triangulation and improve upon my understanding of C++. Along the way, I also picked up some simple yet very effective tips such as pre-processed headers. <br><br> -->
				
				<!-- I was working on a project for the <strong> Department of Defense(US) at the Research Lab (UNC, Charllote) </strong> . The objective was to reconstruct terrain surface from a point cloud using Marching Triangle algorithm. I learnt and used concepts from computational geometry, half-edge data structures and delaunay Triangulation to achieve the results. This was done using C++, OpenGL and CGAL library as the technology infrastructure. <br><br> -->
				
				<!-- Games have also helped me grow as a person, since it taught me to work in a team, especially with people from a non-technical background. --> <!-- The whole idea of working with a designer, a graphic and music artist is very exciting to me and making a game almost feels like making a movie! --> <br><br>
