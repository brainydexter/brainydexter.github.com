				I graduated in May 2010 with a M.S. in Computer Science from University of North Carolina, Charlotte. My focus over these two years has been in writing efficient code and learning software architecture by applying concepts to solving real-time problems. Game development served as my testbed since these are complex systems and wiring them together with efficient code is the key. <br> <br >
				
				<!-- My experience at UNC Charlotte laid the foundation in graphics and gave me an opportunity to learn from varied subjects such as computational photography, game design and development, virtual reality and computational geometry. During this time, I also got interested in developing games as it gave me a platform to try out new ideas. Making games has challenged me to think beyond what I have learnt and realize those ideas into practical implementation. <br><br> -->
				
				I am currently working as a software engineer at Electronic Arts developing software for the next generation of handheld games. With not much time to spare and busy deadlines, I had to quickly bring myself upto speed with their existing system and packages. This process of learning on the job has been very challenging and exciting at the same time. Collaborating with User interface designer and artists established the flow of ideas which turned out to be effective and helped me deliver milestones on time. More details can be found <a href="resume.html" target="_parent" class="gameTitle">here</a>. <br><br>
				
				<!-- <a href="projects.html#Kolor" target="_parent" class="gameTitle"> Kolor</a>, a game mechanic I came up, wherein the player claims other people by coloring them into your own color. I think this project has really helped me see how a game idea is transformed into a working game. The details and the progress I've made so far can be seen <a href="projects.html#Kolor" target="_parent" class="gameTitle"> here</a>. <br><br> -->
				
				As a part of my side-projects, I am developing a 3D First-Person Shooter game, <a href="projects.html#Kolor" target="_parent" class="gameTitle"> Kolor </a>. I have written this game from scratch in C++/OpenGL and Qt Framework. Amidst other things that I did, I am very proud of the library that I wrote to parse and process a Collada DAE model file. This project is quite sizeable and proves to be a good testbed for new concepts that I like to try. The details and the progress I've made so far can be seen <a href="projects.html#Kolor" target="_parent" class="gameTitle"> here</a>. <br><br> 
				
				<!-- My first independently developed game, <a class="gameTitle" href="projects.html#Juhuligan" target="_parent"> Juhuligan</a>, is a mario-contra clone.

				<!-- <a href="projects.html#ROT" target="_parent" class="gameTitle"> Revenge of the Tanks (ROT)</a> was inspired by my childhood favorite game, Scorched earth (dates back to MSDOS days). Ever since I got into making games, I wanted to recreate something similar, and <a href="projects.html#ROT" target="_parent" class="gameTitle">ROT</a> was the result. The game executable and details can be found <a href="projects.html#ROT" target="_parent" class="gameTitle"> here</a>. <br><br> -->
								
				<!-- I am currently working as a Research Assistant with Dr. Zachary Wartell at UNC, Charlotte. We are trying to reconstruct the terrain surface from a point cloud. I am trying to implement this using the Marching Triangle algorithm. My work with Dr. Wartell has helped me enhance my knowledge in computational geometry, half-edge data structures, delaunay Triangulation and improve upon my understanding of C++. Along the way, I also picked up some simple yet very effective tips such as pre-processed headers. <br><br> -->
				
				I was working on a project for the Department of Defense(US), during my masters at UNC, Charlotte. The objective was to reconstruct terrain surface from a point cloud using Marching Triangle algorithm. I learnt and used concepts from computational geometry, half-edge data structures and delaunay Triangulation to achieve the results. This was done using C++, OpenGL and CGAL library as the technology infrastructure. <br><br>
				
				Games have also helped me grow as a person, since it taught me to work in a team, especially with people from a non-technical background. <!-- The whole idea of working with a designer, a graphic and music artist is very exciting to me and making a game almost feels like making a movie! --> <br><br>
