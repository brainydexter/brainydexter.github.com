		<p> Juhuligan is my first big game where my objective was to get a better understanding of how the game-elements work together, especially from a programmer's perspective. Being a side-scroller, there are a lot of different type of game entities interacting in their own ways. Thus, as my previous games have done, this game had exposed me to all sorts of challenges, and now, I have a much better understanding of game programming. Also, I learnt about some of the bad programming practises, the hard way! </p>

		When I started out making this game, I just wanted to improve my game

		already did. Without a vision, I decided that the game would be
		something between mario and contra. This was my biggest flaw! (<a href="#Lessons_Learnt">Lessons

		<ol type="a">
		<li> Draw World from data: <br>
		<p> I recently came to know what I was doing here is data
		driven programming. I populate a world array with a tile number which
		represents which tile to draw from the world tilesheet. At this stage,
		I just populated the array manually. </p>
		</li>
		  <li>Character movement:
		    <p>This was my first hurdle. I would say that this was my
		biggest hurdle for I tried myriad approaches and it was unsolved for a
		long long time (<a href="#Lessons_Learnt">LL #2</a>). But, now I know
		the problem with all the
		approaches that I tried, and it feels good to know them! The solution
		that finally worked for me was what I had thought at the beginning.(<a href="#Lessons_Learnt">LL
		#3</a>) This is what I used in the end: <br>
		<img style="border: 1px solid ; width: 400px; height: 300px;" alt="Collision resolution" src="resources/imgs/juhuligan/collision.png" hspace="2" vspace="10">
		<br>To check for collision, we need the following: </p>
		<ul type="circle">
		<li>Starting Position to be checked (collPos)</li>
		<li>Size or Area which needs to be queried for collision
		(collSize)</li>
		<li>Direction in which the entity is required to move
		(direction)</li>
		<li>Final Position: what would be its final position in
		either case Collision/not (newpos)</li>
		<li> Returns true if a collision takes place, else returns
		false</li>
		<li>private bool Collide(Vector2 collPos, Vector2 collSize,
		Direction direction, out float newpos)</li>
		<ul>
		<li>We then iterate from minX, minY to maxX,maxY;
		checking if there is a tile at either of these locations.</li>
		<li> If there is a collision: return true and set newPos
		to the last x or y depending on "direction".</li>
		<li>Else; set newPos to the extreme X/Y accordingly and
		return false.</li>
		</ul>
		This method is wrapped in another function called Move <br>
		<li>protected virtual Direction Move()</li>
		<ul>
		<li>It assumes that the velocity of the object is setup
		already and takes that into account to determine if it Collides with
		anything in the world. </li>
		<li>Either ways, it moves the object by newPos along X/Y
		depending on the velocity.</li>
		<li>If there is a collision, it is indicated by the
		Direction flag which is returned by the function. Direction is a
		hexadecimal value from 0,1,2,4,8 indicating None, Up, Right, Down, Left.</li>
		</ul>
		</ul>
		  </li>

		</ol>
		<a href="#Top" rel="me">Top</a> <br> <br> <hr>
		<strong><a name="Phase_2"></a>Phase 2:</strong>
		<ol type="a">
		<li>Side-scrolling screen
		<p>This was my second biggest hurdle. And it was hard to go
		on with one big problem followed by another equally painful problem,
		especially after all the head-banging for the character's movement.</p>
		<p>Side-scrolling was not hard to do. I got it going
		relatively easily. What was hard to do was smooth side scrolling. The
		way I coded earlier, it used to move one tile per scrolling. This just
		dint cut through, since I had a some people try it and all of them
		complaint of this one thing. Thus, I needed a way to make it smooth.
		After some crazy nights, I ended up using the concept of World space
		and Screen space, something that I had just learnt in my graphics class
		at school. I had to implement these two functions to transform anything
		from World to Screen space or vice versa, &amp; voila, it worked! I
		had everything happening in the world space. Whatever entity needed to
		draw itself, it would call upon WorldToScreen(Position) to draw in the
		Screen space. The code snippet: </p>
		<ul>
		<li> <code> <strong>public Vector2
		WorldToScreen(Vector2 worldPosn)</strong> { Vector2 screenPosn =
		Vector2.Zero; screenPosn.X = worldPosn.X - viewPort.X; screenPosn.X *=
		Constants.TileWidth; screenPosn.Y = worldPosn.Y - viewPort.Y;
		screenPosn.Y *= Constants.TileHeight; return screenPosn; } </code>
		</li>
		<li> <strong>public Vector2 ScreenToWorld(Vector2
		screenPosn)</strong> { Vector2 worldPosn = Vector2.Zero;
		screenPosn.X /= Constants.TileWidth; worldPosn.X = viewPort.X +
		screenPosn.X; screenPosn.Y /= Constants.TileHeight; worldPosn.Y =
		viewPort.Y + screenPosn.Y; return worldPosn; }</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Enemies
		    <ol type="i">
		      <li>Enemy player
		  <p> This part of the code really was not too hard to do,
		especially with all the ground work done. Though, this required to put
		my OO skills to test. It finally led me to develop, what I call as,
		  <a href="#MoM_Architecture">Manager of Manager (MoM) architecture</a>.
		I used EnemyManager and the
		minions as the enemies themselves.</p>
		        <img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 427px; height: 197px;" alt="Enemy Mgr and Enemy Relation" src="resources/imgs/juhuligan/UML_Enemy-Mgr.png" vspace="10"><br>
		&nbsp;<br></li>
		      <li> Different types of AI enemies
		  <p> Also, I wanted to make it efficient, so that I dont
		update/draw enemies that are not anywhere even near the player. (It
		made no sense to update/draw an enemy that is to be found at the end of
		the level, when the player is on the first screen). Thus, I had a bool
		'active' flag which denoted when to activate/deactivate enemy (using
		ActivateEnemies()). Only active enemies were updated/drawn. For
		different types of enemies, I first identified the enemy behaviours and
		used simple 1 level of inheritance. </p>
		  <br>
		<img style="width: 713px; height: 443px;" alt="Enemy Hierarchy" src="resources/imgs/juhuligan/UML_Enemy_Hierarchy.png" vspace="10">
		  <br>
		The generic enemy class made it
		very easy to add any other type of enemy. I just had to override update
		for the specific behavior. </li>
		    </ol>

		</li>
		</ol>
		<a href="#Top" rel="me">Top</a> <br> <br> <hr>
		<strong><a name="Phase_3"></a>Phase 3:</strong>
		<ol>
		  <li>Player has a gun and can shoot anywhere
		  <p>My weapon class had two
		variants of update function: one for its parent ResourceManager and the
		other for player. Nothing much to say here, since it conforms to the
		  <a href="#MoM_Architecture">MoM architecture</a>. Also, Weapon Class
		takes care of the input mouse
		click and pointing the bullets in the right direction.
		One thing to note here is, both the enemies and player use the same
		bullet class. For different trajectories of the bullet, they are
		identified using enumerator. Since, the distinction between different
		bullets' trajectory is more data oriented, thus I chose not to go in
		for inheritance.
		I would also like to mention about my approach to getting the curved
		trajectory for bullets. I did not use sin and cosine functions!! When I
		started writing code for this, I realized I was making too many calls
		to sine and cosine. With these being called every frame, I just couldnt
		go ahead with it. My first trajectory that I had to try out was a sine
		curve for the Frogger.
		  </p>
		    <img style="width: 634px; height: 336px;" alt="Approximate bullet Sine curve" src="resources/imgs/juhuligan/SineBullet.png"><br>

		<br>
		I realised if I increase/decrease the Y with X always increasing, it
		would work for me!! I played around with some variables for some time
		and voila, it works beautifully. All I had to do was:
		if (velocity.Y &gt; 0.4f) signY = -1;
		else if (velocity.Y &lt; -0.4f) signY = 1;
		velocity.Y += (signY * 0.025f);
		    <p> Here, as soon as I hit the
		threshold of 0.4 as height, I reverse the direction of Y and update the
		velocity accordingly. Its a simple, yet a very effective solution to my
		problem of calling sine to calculate the final velocity.
		The other type of trajectory was the boomerang type. I was not shooting
		for a perfect circular trajectory, but an approximate elliptical
		trajectory. Again, I decided to use the rate of change of X with
		respect to Y. It took me some time to get the proportions right,
		otherwise, if X and Y are not changing in the right proportions; the
		final trajectory would go haywire and I had all sorts of wierd(yet
		beautiful :-) ) paths!
		<br>

		    <img style="border: 1px solid ; width: 800px; height: 500px;" alt="Approximate boomerang trajectory" src="resources/imgs/juhuligan/boomerang.png" vspace="10"><br>
		After a while, I thought I'll try to write generic equations in terms
		of X and Y to yield me the curve that I wanted. After spending a lot of
		time and reading around, I was enlightened to read about Bezier curves.
		This is exactly what I was trying to invent! I was doing the same thing
		as the equation did, but I was working on the data. Anyways, I feel
		really proud of discovering<a href="#Bezier_Curve_Library"> Bezier
		curves </a>the way I did. </p>
		  </li>
		<li> Player-Enemy has health &amp; bullet damage in effect
		<p> With all the code around, this was fairly easy to do. I
		had a OO design
		issue when I was dealing with this. This part of the code really
		puzzled me for some time since it wanted me to tightly couple the enemy
		and player together. I finally ended up putting all the enemy and their
		bullet interaction with the player in the EnemyManager class. I realize
		this is a really bad way to do things but I look forward to improving
		my OO skills to get around this. I needed some arbitrator to resolve
		the outcome of collisions.

		</ol>
		<a href="#Top" rel="me">Top</a> <br> <br> <hr>
		<strong><a name="Phase_4"></a>Phase 4:</strong>
		<ol>
		<li> Player can do powerups: Ammo pack/ Health Pack/ Armor
		<p>This was implemented as yet another <a href="#MoM_Architecture">MoM architecture</a>. This
		suffers from tight coupling between the player and ResourceManager.
		Here, I implemented a <a href="#Timer_functionality">timer functionality</a> with multiple modes which
		allowed resources to be spawned in places only for a specific time
		duration. This was again based on the trigger set in the world.
		</p>
		</li>
		<li> Player has Lives and Checkpoint system
		<p>Influenced by mario, 100 coins yield a life to the player.
		Also, there are checkpoints embedded within the world. If a player
		crosses a certain checkpoint and dies after that, the player is
		re-spawned at the last checkpoint he crossed. Also, this strips the
		player of any weapon/ammo he was carrying on him.
		</p>
		</li>
		<li> Everyone needs a HUD </li>
		<p>
		I wanted to make HUD more interesting than the usual HUD we have. I
		also wanted to keep it simple, else it would be too much for the player
		to handle. For one thing in particular, I needed a way to represent the
		player's health. After trying out different ideas, this one thing stuck
		with me. I finally decided to have a face which would give an idea of
		Player's health. Now, my concern was; the face expression would have to
		be changing dynamically, as the player takes a hit or a health pack. I
		pin-pointed the eye-brows and smiley feat to give the player an idea of
		its mood! My knowledge of <a href="#Bezier_Curve_Library">Bezier curves</a> really came in handy here and
		thus came about; my own generic <a href="#Bezier_Curve_Library">Bezier curve library</a> functions. To
		these functions, I simply provided the weighted points and it would
		return a list of points along the curve:
		</p>
		<ul>
		<li>public static List &lt;Vector2&gt;
		Quadratic(Vector2
		p0, Vector2 p1,Vector2 p2) </li>
		<li>public static List &lt; Vector2&gt;
		Linear(Vector2 p0,
		Vector2 p1) </li>
		</ul>
		</ol><img style="width: 210px; height: 200px;" alt="HUD using bezier curves" src="resources/imgs/juhuligan/HUD.png" align="left" hspace="5">Red Dots are the weight points for smiley<br>
		All of these update dynamically based on the health of the player<br>
		<ol>
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  <br>
		I now intend to write a generic function where the degree of the curve
		can be specified and requisite points.<br>

		<strong><a name="Phase_5"></a>Phase 5:</strong>
		<ol>
		<li> Game State Management
		<p>Having used Microsoft's Game State Management, I just had
		a strong urge to write my own. I also wanted to learn to write my own
		state/menu manager. I tried to search something useful, but all that I
		came across was the State Design Pattern. Well, this is what I used to
		make my own! It basically breaks down into two parts:
		</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Game States: Introduction/Menu Display/Game End</li>
		<li>GamePlayer state: Gameplay/Pause/Win or Loss state</li>
		</ul>
		I used a combination of List and Stacks to manipulate/draw different
		states.
		</li>
		<li> Sound effects
		<p>A <a href="#Sound_utility">generic sound component</a> in sync with XACT came in real
		handy. This component takes care of running background song and sound
		effects during the game.
		</p>
		</li>
		<li> Critique
		<p>Throughout the course of the game, I often asked my
		friends for feedback about the feats which has helped me to improve them.

		Manager of Manager (MoM) software architecture</strong>:

		initializing/loading/updating/drawing the minions. I often use List<t>
		as the data structure since objects keep adding/deleting thereby making
		the size required to be dynamic. This architecture forces minions to
		return an enum UpdateAction on invoking Update() method; to indicate if
		the given object needs to be removed from the manager. Also, with my
		newly found knowledge, I think this closely follows the Observer Design
		Pattern (but I was not aware of this when I wrote this game :( ).
